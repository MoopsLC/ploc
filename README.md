Count lines of code based on a pattern.

Everyone knows that lines of code are the most important measure of, 
well pretty much anything having to do with software. More is more! 
Gamify programming! Numbers! Let's count them!

In reality, this is just a script I use when I'm curious as to 
how many lines of what language a particular program is. The script also
reports which files are the largest, which can be useful when trying
to tame complexity or identify beefy modules.

For usage, see the perldoc.
